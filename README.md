### Hi there 👋

🙋‍♂️ I am a Full Stack Software Developer with a great interest in technology, mainly in the development area, where I focus on creating simple solutions to complex problems.

👨🏻‍💻 At the moment, I am part of Celcoin's integration team, working in the cel_cash BU, where its focus is managing single and recurring charges mainly for business customers. On this team, I worked on APIs focusing on payment and receipt on PIX, connections with the Rede acquirer for processing credit card charges, acquiring and integration with a FMI to record receivables.

⚒️ The main tools and languages I work with are PHP with the Laravel framework, Golang, Python, ReactJs with the NextJs framework, MySql, architectural services such as Docker and AWS.

🌱 I am currently improving my skills in **RabbitMQ**, **Go**, **AWS** and **Data Structures & Algorithms** by solving **Leetcode** challenges daily!

🚀 I always try to update myself and grow, both as a person and as a software developer, I love to share knowledge and also learn from different people. Let's connect!
