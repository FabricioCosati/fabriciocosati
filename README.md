### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Software Developer from Brazil!

ðŸŒ± I am currently studying **NodeJS**, **TypeScript** and **PHP** with **Laravel** framework and I plan to study **React** in a near future.

ðŸ˜„ When I'm not studying, I'm probably watching animes or playing strategy/management games.

âš¡ I like to look for new challenges where I can develop solutions to improve my knowledge and my skills in the development area
